.Sh NAME
.Nm httpstatus
.Nd HTTP status codes
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the HTTP status codes
commonly issued by a web server in response to a
client request.
The status codes in this manual page are based on the
information found in RFC7231 unless otherwise noted.
.Pp
HTTP status codes fall into one of five classes,
identified by the first digit as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It 1xx (Informational)
The request was received, continuing process.
.It 2xx (Successful)
The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
.It 3xx (Redirection)
Further action needs to be taken in order to complete
the request.
.It 4xx (Client Error)
The request contains bad syntax or cannot be
fulfilled.
.It 5xx (Server Error)
The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid
request.
.El
.Sh 1xx STATUS CODES
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It 100 Continue
The server has received the initial part of the
request and the client should proceed to send the
remainder.
.It 101 Switching Protocols
The server agrees to the client's request to switch
protocols via the RFC7230 "Upgrade" header.
.It 102 Processing
The server has has accepted the complete request,
but has not yet completed it.
(WebDAV; RFC2518)
.It 103 Early Hints
The server is likely to send a final response with the
header fields included in the informational response.
(RFC8297)
.El
.Sh 2xx STATUS CODES
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It 200 Ok
The request has succeeded.
.It 201 Created
The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one
or more new resources being created.
.It 202 Accepted
The request has been accepted for processing, but the
processing has not been completed.
.It 203 Non-Authoritative Information
The request was successful but the enclosed payload has
been modified from that of the origin server's 200
(OK) response by a transforming proxy.
.It 204 No Content
The server has successfully fulfilled the request;
there is no additional content to send in the response
payload body.
.It 205 Reset Content
The server has fulfilled the request; the client
should reset its document view.
.It 206 Partial Content
The server is successfully fulfilling a range request
for the target resource based on the client's "Range"
header. (RFC7233)
.It 207 Multi-Status
Multiple resources were to be affected by the COPY,
but errors on some of them prevented the operation
from taking place. (WebDAV; RFC4918)
.It 208 Already Reported
Indicates that members of multiple bindings from a previous
multi-status response are not repeated.
(WebDAV; RFC5842)
.It 226 IM Used
The server has fulfilled a GET request for the
resource, and the response is a representation of the
result of one or more instance- manipulations applied
to the current instance.
(RFC3229)
.El
.Sh 3xx STATUS CODES
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It 300 Multiple Choices
The target resource has more than one representation
which the client may choose from via Content
Negotiation.
.It 301 Moved Permanently
The target resource has been assigned a new permanent
URI and any future references to this resource ought
to use one of the enclosed URIs.
.It 302 Found
The target resource resides temporarily under a
different URI.
.It 303 See Other
The server is redirecting the user agent to a
different resource, as indicated by a URI in the
Location header field.
.It 304 Not Modified
A conditional GET or HEAD request has been received
and would have resulted in a 200 (OK) response if it
were not for the fact that the condition evaluated to
false.
(RFC7232)
.It 305 Use Proxy
The requested resource MUST be accessed through the
proxy given by the Location field. (RFC2616)
Deprecated due to security concerns regarding in-band
configuration of a proxy.
.It 306 Switch Proxy
No longer used.
Originally generated by a proxy server to indicate
that the client or proxy should use the information in
the accompanying 'Set- proxy' header to choose a proxy
for subsequent requests.
.It 307 Temporary Redirect
The target resource resides temporarily under a
different URI and the user agent MUST NOT change the
request method if it performs an automatic redirection
to that URI.
.It 308 Permanent Redirect
The target resource has been assigned a new permanent
URI and any future references to this resource ought
to use one of the enclosed URIs.
(RFC7538)
.El
.Sh 4xx STATUS CODES
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It 400 Bad Request
The server cannot or will not process the request due
to something that is perceived to be a client error
(e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request
message framing, or deceptive request routing).
.It 401 Unauthorized
The request has not been applied because it lacks
valid authentication credentials for the target
resource.
.It 402 Payment Required
Reserved for future use.
.It 403 Forbidden
The server understood the request but refuses to
authorize it.
.It 404 Not Found
The origin server did not find a current
representation for the target resource or is not
willing to disclose that one exists.
.It 405 Method Not Allowed
The method received in the request-line is known by
the origin server but not supported by the target
resource.
.It 406 Not Acceptable
The target resource does not have a current
representation that would be acceptable to the user
agent, such as due to the client's "Accept" header.
.It 407 Proxy Authentication Required
The client needs to authenticate itself in order to
use a proxy.
(RFC7235)
.It 408 Request Timeout
The server did not receive a complete request message
within the time that it was prepared to wait.
.It 409 Conflict
The request could not be completed due to a conflict
with the current state of the target resource.
.It 410 Gone
Access to the target resource is no longer available
at the origin server; this condition is likely to be
permanent.
.It 411 Length Required
The server refuses to accept the request without a
defined Content-Length.
.It 412 Precondition Failed
One or more conditions given in the request header
fields evaluated to false when tested on the server.
(RFC7232)
.It 413 Payload Too Large
The server is refusing to process a request because
the request payload is larger than the server is
willing or able to process.
.It 414 URI Too Long
The server is refusing to service the request because
the request-target is longer than the server is
willing to interpret.
.It 415 Unsupported Media Type
The origin server is refusing to service the request
because the payload is in a format not supported by
this method on the target resource.
.It 416 Range Not Satisfiable
None of the ranges in the request's Range header field
overlap the current extent of the selected resource or
the set of ranges requested has been rejected due to
invalid ranges or an excessive request of small or
overlapping ranges.

.It 417 Expectation Failed
The expectation given in the request's Expect header
field could not be met by at least one of the inbound
servers.
.It 418 I'm a teapot
An attempt to brew coffee was made, even though the
target is a teapot.
(RFC2324)
.It 421 Misdirected Request
The request was directed at a server that is not able
to produce a response.
(RFC7540)
.It 422 Unprocessable Entity

entity and the syntax of the request entity is
correct, but was unable to process the contained
instructions.
(WebDAV; RFC4918)
.It 423 Locked
The source or destination resource of a method is
locked.
(WebDAV; RFC4918)
.It 424 Failed Dependency 
The method could not be performed on the resource
because the requested action depended on another
action and that action failed.
(WebDAV; RFC4918)
.It 425 Too Early
The server is unwilling to risk processing a request
that might be replayed.
(RFC8470)
.It 426 Upgrade Required

current protocol but might be willing to do so after
the client upgrades to a different protocol.
.It 428 Precondition Required

conditional.
(RFC6585)
.It 429 Too Many Requests
The user has sent too many requests in a given amount
of time.
(RFC6585)
.It 431 Request Header Fields Too Large
The server is unwilling to process the request because
its header fields are too large.
(RFC6585)
.It 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons
The server is denying access to the resource as a
consequence of a legal demand.

Named after Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451".
.El
.Sh 5xx STATUS CODES
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It 500 Internal Server Error
The server encountered an unexpected condition that
prevented it from fulfilling the request.
.It 501 Not Implemented
The server does not support the functionality required
to fulfill the request.
.It 502 Bad Gateway
The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy,
received an invalid response from an inbound server it
accessed while attempting to fulfill the request.
.It 503 Service Unavailable
The server is currently unable to handle the request
due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance,
which will likely be alleviated after some delay.
.It 504 Gateway Timeout
The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did
not receive a timely response from an upstream server
it needed to access in order to complete the request.
.It 505 HTTP Version Not Supported
The server does not support, or refuses to support,
the major version of HTTP that was used in the request
message.
.It 506 Variant Also Negotiates
The server's chosen variant resource is configured to
engage in transparent content negotiation itself, and
is therefore not a proper end point in the negotiation
process.
(RFC2295)

The method could not be performed on the resource
because the server is unable to store the
representation needed to successfully complete the
request.
